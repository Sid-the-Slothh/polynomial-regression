# polynomial-regression
Making a polynomial regression model from scratch, using numpy and pyplot (for utility). 

Goals:
  - To make a model that would scan the search space for the degree of the model fitted, and return the one with the lowest RMSE.
  - To implement this use Cython (or however they use C/C++ to accelerate libraries in python) to make this a proper lib
