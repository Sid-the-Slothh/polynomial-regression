# polynomial-regression
- Making a polynomial regression model from scratch, using numpy and pyplot (for utility). 

- The playground ipynb was used for development. You can check that out if you want to learn how I made the library.

## Goals:
  - To make a model that would scan the search space for the degree of the model fitted, and return the one with the lowest RMSE. (done)
  - To implement this use Cython (or however they use C/C++ to accelerate libraries in python) to make this a proper lib
